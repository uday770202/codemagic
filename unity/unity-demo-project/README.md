# Unity demo project

The **codemagic.yaml** in this project can be used as a starter template for building and publishing your Unity iOS and Android applications with Codemagic CI/CD.
## Prerequisites

- A Unity **Plus** or **Pro** license. Your license is used to activate Unity on the Codemagic build server so the iOS and Android projects can be exported. The license is then returned before the workflow builds and publishes your apps to the App Store and Google Play.
- If you are publishing to the Apple App Store you will need an active membership for the Apple Developer Program.
- For publishing to Google Play you will require an active Google Play Developer account.
